# What is this?
I recently became interested in trading card games. One thing that facinated me was that there were just SO MANY CARDS. There are around 27,000 unique Magic: The Gathering cards, 13,000 Pokemon cards, and between 11,000 and 12,500 Yu-Gi-Oh cards depending on what kind of cards you count (I don't understand how Yu-Gi-Oh works). But most card game players only use around 50 cards at a time. But what if players wern't able to choose their cards? And what if there were no "set" cards at all, but procedurally generated cards that worked together to create unique gameplay? Players would have to be both incredibly knowledgable of the overall card game system AND lucky enough to get cards that work well together to succeed. I am not entirly sure if this project will end up being fun to play, but it is an interesting enough concept to me that I am going to try to pursue it.
